# Project Background

## Overview
The Aggregated Feed Service is a backend API service designed to solve the problem of content fragmentation across multiple platforms. In today's digital landscape, users often follow content creators across different platforms, making it challenging to keep track of all updates in one place.

## Problem Statement
1. **Content Fragmentation**
   - Users need to visit multiple platforms to follow their favorite creators
   - No unified way to consume content from different sources
   - Time-consuming to check updates across various platforms

2. **User Experience Challenges**
   - Inconsistent content delivery across platforms
   - Difficulty in managing following relationships
   - Lack of centralized content consumption

## Solution
The Aggregated Feed Service addresses these challenges by:

1. **Content Aggregation**
   - Centralizes content from multiple platforms
   - Provides a unified API for content access
   - Maintains a single source of truth for user following relationships

2. **Simplified Architecture**
   - Read-only API design for efficient content delivery
   - Single-user focused approach for simplicity
   - Clear separation of concerns between data consumption and production

### Architecture Choices
1. **Read-Only Design**
   - Separates concerns between data ingestion and consumption
   - Allows for better performance optimization
   - Reduces complexity in the API layer

2. **Single-User Mode**
   - Simplifies the implementation
   - Reduces security complexity
   - Focuses on core functionality first

## Future Considerations
1. **Potential Enhancements**
   - Multi-user support
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Real-time updates
   - Content filtering and personalization

2. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling capabilities
   - Caching strategies
   - Performance optimization

## Project Goals
1. **Primary Goals**
   - Provide a reliable content aggregation service
   - Ensure efficient content delivery
   - Maintain simple and clean architecture

2. **Secondary Goals**
   - Easy to maintain and extend
   - Good developer experience
   - Clear documentation

## Success Metrics
1. **Technical Metrics**
   - API response times
   - System reliability
   - Code maintainability

2. **Business Metrics**
   - Content delivery efficiency
   - User satisfaction
   - System scalability
