# Cookie Maintenance System Design

## Overview
The cookie maintenance system is designed to handle the automated management and updating of cookies for the Xiaohongshu crawler. It consists of two main components:
1. Cookie Maintenance Service
2. User Interaction Service

## Architecture

### 1. Cookie Maintenance Service

#### Purpose
- Manages browser automation for cookie retrieval
- Stores and updates cookies for different platforms
- Provides cookie retrieval API for crawlers

#### Components

##### Browser Manager
- Manages Playwright browser instances
- Handles browser lifecycle (launch, close)
- Implements browser pooling for efficiency
- Handles browser cleanup and resource management

##### Cookie Manager
- Stores cookies in a secure database
- Implements cookie validation and expiration checks
- Provides cookie retrieval endpoints
- Handles cookie format conversion

##### Platform Handlers
- Platform-specific implementations (e.g., XiaohongshuHandler)
- Contains platform-specific login flows
- Manages platform-specific cookie formats
- Implements platform-specific validation

#### API Endpoints
```
GET /api/cookies/{platform}
POST /api/cookies/{platform}/refresh
GET /api/cookies/{platform}/status
```

#### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE cookies (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    platform VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    cookie_data JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP,
    is_valid BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);
```

### 2. User Interaction Service

#### Purpose
- Handles user interaction for authentication flows
- Manages communication with users via Telegram
- Coordinates with Cookie Maintenance Service

#### Components

##### Telegram Bot
- Handles user commands and messages
- Manages authentication flow states
- Sends QR codes and instructions
- Validates user responses

##### Interaction Manager
- Manages interaction sessions
- Tracks authentication states
- Coordinates between bot and cookie service
- Handles timeouts and retries

##### Message Templates
- Standardized message formats
- Multi-language support
- Platform-specific instructions

#### Bot Commands
```
/login {platform} - Initiate login process
/status - Check authentication status
/cancel - Cancel current operation
/help - Show available commands
```

## Integration Flow

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Cookie Maintenance Service starts and initializes browser pool
   - User Interaction Service connects to Telegram API
   - Both services register with service discovery

2. **Cookie Refresh Flow**
   ```
   Crawler -> Cookie Service: Request cookies
   Cookie Service: Check cookie validity
   If invalid:
     Cookie Service -> Interaction Service: Request login
     Interaction Service -> User: Send login request
     User -> Interaction Service: /login xiaohongshu
     Interaction Service -> Cookie Service: Initiate login
     Cookie Service: Launch browser
     Cookie Service -> Interaction Service: Send QR code
     Interaction Service -> User: Send QR code
     User: Scan QR code
     Cookie Service: Capture cookies
     Cookie Service: Store cookies
     Cookie Service -> Crawler: Return cookies
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   - Timeout handling for user interactions
   - Retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Fallback strategies for browser automation
   - Error reporting and monitoring

## Security Considerations

1. **Cookie Storage**
   - Encrypted storage for sensitive data
   - Secure transmission of cookies
   - Access control for cookie retrieval

2. **User Authentication**
   - Telegram user verification
   - Rate limiting for login attempts
   - Session management

3. **Browser Security**
   - Isolated browser instances
   - Clean browser state between sessions
   - Secure browser configuration

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **Metrics**
   - Cookie refresh success rate
   - User interaction response time
   - Browser pool utilization
   - Error rates by platform

2. **Logging**
   - Authentication flow events
   - Browser automation logs
   - User interaction logs
   - Error and exception tracking

## Deployment

### Cookie Maintenance Service
- Containerized deployment
- Horizontal scaling for browser pool
- Resource limits for browser instances
- Health checks and monitoring

### User Interaction Service
- Containerized deployment
- Stateless design for scaling
- Rate limiting configuration
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Future Considerations

1. **Platform Expansion**
   - Support for additional platforms
   - Platform-specific optimizations
   - Custom authentication flows

2. **Interaction Channels**
   - Support for additional messaging platforms
   - Web interface for authentication
   - Mobile app integration

3. **Automation Improvements**
   - AI-based cookie validation
   - Automated cookie refresh
   - Smart browser pool management
